# Power-consumption-Forecast--Mini-Project.
Power consumption forecast for buildings on time-series data using Machine Learning models.
This project aims at predicting power consumption for hourly power consumption data.
We tried the same using several machine learning algorithms with different input sequences like 12:1,12:24;48:1 and 48:12.
Models trained:
Random Forest
XGBoost
KNN
Best Output Observed:
Random Forest.
